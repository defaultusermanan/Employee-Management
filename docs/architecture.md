# Architecture Overview

The Employee Management System is built with modularity and efficiency in mind. Below is an overview of its architecture and key components.

## Core Components

### 1. File and Directory Management

- **`@nodelib/fs.scandir`**: Used for listing files and directories with support for symbolic links and broken links.
- **`@nodelib/fs.walk`**: Provides recursive directory traversal with filtering capabilities.

### 2. Caching

- **`@alloc/quick-lru`**: Implements a fast and efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache for managing in-memory data.

### 3. Source Map Handling

- **`@jridgewell/gen-mapping`**: Generates source maps during transpilation or minification.
- **`@jridgewell/trace-mapping`**: Traces original positions through source maps for debugging purposes.

### 4. Promise Handling

- **`any-promise`**: Allows the use of any ES6-compatible Promise implementation, giving flexibility to the application.

## Dependency Management

The project uses `npm` for dependency management. All dependencies are listed in `package.json` and are installed in the `node_modules` directory.

## Modular Design

Each module is designed to handle a specific aspect of the application, ensuring separation of concerns and ease of maintenance.
